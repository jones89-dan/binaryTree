  1:  To be or not to be that is the question 
  2:  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings 
  3:  and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against 
  4:  a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To 
  5:  die to sleep No more and by a sleep to 
  6:  say we end The heart ache and the thousand natural 
  7:  shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation Devoutly 
  8:  to be wish'd To die to sleep To sleep perchance 
  9:  to dream ay there's the rub For in that sleep 
 10:  of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled 
 11:  off this mortal coil Must give us pause There's the 
 12:  respect That makes calamity of so long life For who 
 13:  would bear the whips and scorns of time Th' oppressor's 
 14:  wrong the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love 
 15:  the law's delay The insolence of office and the spurns 
 16:  That patient merit of th' unworthy takes When he himself 
 17:  might his quietus make With a bare bodkin who would 
 18:  fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life 
 19:  But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd 
 20:  country from whose bourn No traveller returns puzzles the will 
 21:  And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than 
 22:  fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience 
 23:  does make cowards of us all And thus the native 
 24:  hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast 
 25:  of thought And enterprises of great pith and moment With 
 26:  this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name 
 27:  of action
